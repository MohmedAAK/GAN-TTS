# GAN-TTS

this is a code for vocoder model MelGan model that takes mels and convert speach , if you are looking or code to train vocoder instead of using inferance or python scripts in tensorflow, you hit the jackpot as i show the model and how to train it and you can change model loss and i use pre-trained model so you can see its structure edit it using the library or make your own model and train vocoder or GAN model in mel to voice models 

good luck :)
